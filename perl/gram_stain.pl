   	<p style = "font: 12px verdana; margin:10px; text-align: justify; line-height:20px; line-height:20px;"> The Gram stain is used to classify bacteria on the basis of their forms, sizes, cellular morphologies, and Gram reactions; in a clinical microbiology laboratory, it
is additionally a critical test for the rapid presumptive diagnosis of infectious agents and serves to assess the quality of clinical specimens. The test was originally developed by Christian Gram in 1884, but was modified by Hucker in 1921. The modified procedure provided greater reagent stability and better differentiation of organisms. Other modifications have been specifically developed for staining anaerobes and for weakly staining gram-negative bacilli (Legionella spp., Campylobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., Brucella spp.) by using a carbol-fuchsin or basic fuchsin counterstain. Interpretation of Gram-stained smears involves consideration of staining characteristics and cell size, shape, and arrangement. These characteristics may be influences by a number of variables, including culture age, media, incubation atmosphere, staining methods, and the presence of inhibitory substances. Similar considerations apply to the interpretation of smears from clinical specimens, and additional factors include different host cell types and possible phagocytosis. </p>
   	<p style = "font: 12px verdana; margin:10px; text-align: justify; line-height:20px; line-height:20px;"> Gram stain permits the separation of all bacteria into two large groups, those which retain the primary dye (gram-positive) and those that take the color of the
counterstain (gram-negative). The primary dye is crystal violet and the secondary dye is usually either safranin O or basic fuchsin. Some of the more common formulations include: saturated crystal violet (approximately 1%), Huckerâ€™s crystal violet, and 2% alcoholic crystal violet </p>
